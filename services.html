        To enhance our servicing, we have improved the choices that our
        customers can make. We have designed our servicing around your bike,
        rather than having services that meet the needs of our workshop. We want
        you to be able to choose exactly the services you need, rather than pay
        for work that you may not require. All of our services include the
        following:
